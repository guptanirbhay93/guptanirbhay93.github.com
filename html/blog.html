          <p>
            India, a country with a billion population and only 13% internet penetration, sits at a very interesting juncture. A country
            where more people have a smartphone and internet connection than the ones who have ever used a computer. Digital
            payments in India are on the rise and with demonetisation of currency notes have inadvertently has helped it.
            Paytm came out to be the winner.
          </p>
          <p>
            India's economy is majorly is cash-based(Ignoring city-dwellers with credit card toting dwellers those who reside in them).
            Digital currencies represent the same cash-based economy. Cash has a problem, slow to move and possible to damage.
            Cryptocurrencies take those away, crypto-part in them keeps the anonymity intact. Current Digital payment services,
            also provide the same services, but the issue with them is data-collection and customer profiling. With India,
            where data security principles are loosely taken or implemented by these service providers. Data is itself is
            becoming is new market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital currencies are store of value in digial format, they still represent a legimate currency. Cryptocurrencies are plagued
            by this issue, and nay-sayers for the cryto always make their argument with this. I also agree there has to something
            that must be able quantify or translate this value into another currency seamlessly. Something hopefully the
            future has for cryptocurrency.
          </p>
          <p> About a year ago from today, digital payment acceptance by local/corner shop owners were not-existent. Today, my
            grocer loves to take the payments digitally. So it brings us to the question, how does cryptocurrencies come
            fit into all this. Well, cryto-currencies can be seen as the future version of today's digital wallet services.
            Decentralization, is the key word here. These service providers and their services are fallible, prone to hacker
            attack and also prone to government-forced intervertion because they are centralized. Now, if the network is
            spread over the entire country, continent or earth, lesser chances for above mentioned maladies. They also mimick
            the cash based economies completely.
          </p>
          <p> All I want that to be not tracked by companies using my transaction history to sell me more stuff.</p>
