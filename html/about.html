          <p> From building simple webpages in school to building machine learning platform has been one of a kind journey.</p>
          <p>
            Sometimes career's choose you. Creating software has become a passionate and gratifying process. Journey started after college
            when I was assisting a small incubator in India help setup operations in Delhi. I came along a person with simple
            project to design the landing project for them. </p>

          <p>Little did I know that small project would lay foundation of a career that I will both enjoy and challenging. I
            went to join Grappus ( A Digital Products Company ) which was redefining UI/UX development for Indian businesses.
            A year long association with was the most steepest learning curve and gruelling.
          </p>

          <p>Currently, I work with SimpleDataLabs (A Machine Learning Startup) in the Software Engineer role where I have developed
            User Interface and REST APIs for a BigData/ML product. When I am not working you would find me binging in Netflix
            or riding my bike.
          </p>
          <p>For the movie lovers, 'Sicario' is a once in a lifetime watch. </p>
          <p>For nature lovers, if you happening to be in Gurgaon, ping me and I will take you on a one of the lesser known
            treks where lakes come in a bunch.</p>
